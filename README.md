## Entangled in the Scripts

We check which factors (size of voacnulary, language set, balance between languages) affect multilingual tokenization in LMs.

Then, we analyze how multilingual tokenization (share of each language in multilingual voabulary, overlap of vocabularies of specific languages) affect performance on down-stream tasks and  cross-lingual transfer.
